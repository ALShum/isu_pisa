Hi Ames!
 
Hi CR!

Map:
-- what countries are not included
-- match country names
-- Plot countries not included
-- PV1, PV2, ... performance variables

Alex: averaged performance values

out of school hours interesting!
  finland low (finland is an educ model)
  kazakstan 24 hours!
  japan low
  
  parent income with student performance

Include other measures like 10 pctlile facetted not just median - IJL plots

NYT cartogram re: AIDS

Luke suggests supplementing data if need be from wikipedia

Possible threads:
  Do parents matter? Do students work hard outside of school to perform better
  How is income inequity related to performance?
  Composite home life index
