Di's explorations:

Maps, inserts, and can pull polygons for any country and re-plot elsewhere (map.Rmd), pca of math scores, school effects
Computed combined possessions score (possessions.Rmd), also age at start, gender
Using dotplots to explore variation between countries, Australia is shown to have some of the largest variation - surprises me! Is this due to individual variation, or school? Summarize by school and top students from worst schools do way better than worst students from top schools - is there a better way to show? Variation between school is similar for each country. I thought some countries had really big differences.
Generally possessions lead to better average scores, this holds true from country to country, some countries have bigger effect than other, Albania is an oddball
Average math vs average possessions per country, shows a trend, but some unusual countries, vietnam not many possessions but great scores
Age at start school matters, across all countries - school start is typically 4, 5, 6, 7
Gender gap is present in many countries, but not all - No gap in China, Finland, Sweden - reverse gender gap in Jordan, Qatar, Malaysia, Thailand, UAE, Iceland. Colombia worst for gender gap.

Luke:

housewife effect, looks to universally have lower math scores, check NA rate


Ian: 

Books and televisions different effect depending on type of country

Occupations: Keep counts, calculate averages of three scores
Age at school
Reasons for failure, top 20/bottom 20: surprising that NZ comes up as having a big difference
Albania strange out-of-hours study
Predicted advantage by socio-economic

Hi Ames!
 
Hi CR!

Map:
-- what countries are not included
-- match country names
-- Plot countries not included
-- PV1, PV2, ... performance variables

Alex: averaged performance values

out of school hours interesting!
  finland low (finland is an educ model)
  kazakstan 24 hours!
  japan low
  
  parent income with student performance

Include other measures like 10 pctlile facetted not just median - IJL plots

NYT cartogram re: AIDS

Luke suggests supplementing data if need be from wikipedia

Possible threads:
  Do parents matter? Do students work hard outside of school to perform better
  How is income inequity related to performance?
  Composite home life index

compare immigration and emigration rates to gini

why do math gini's behave they way they do?

Possible variables to focus on:

   - type of mathematical ability (var 500 onwards)
   - country of birth, language (var 376 onwards, 449)
   - psychology - (var 79 on, 454, 495 on
   - parents table
   - teacher behavior, style (var 480...)
   - material possessions (var 44...., 284)
   - out of school activity (var 307...)
   

How should final student weight be incorporated?
