# isu_pisa

This is a github repo for a set of Iowa State University entries to the PISA data vis contest @ use!R 2014.

My initial thought is that we could each independently keep copies of the data files in our copies of the `data`, in an effort to keep the repo light. 

If this attempt at keeping a smaller repo is too "90's", we can add the data in.
